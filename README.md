# Task03 - Email Analysis

**Task Instructions**:

With the provided information, OOPS was quickly able to identify the employee associated with the account. During the incident response interview, the user mentioned that they would have been checking email around the time that the communication occurred. They don't remember anything particularly weird from earlier, but it was a few weeks back, so they're not sure. OOPS has provided a subset of the user's inbox from the day of the communication.

Identify the message ID of the malicious email and the targeted server.
